    "text": "Introduction\nWhere am I exactly on the earth? This is not a new question–or an easy one to answer accurately. For close to 300 years surveyors have been crisscrossing the North American lands that Europeans have settled on. Where there is Western civilization there is ownership and government, both requiring accurate borders.\nThe most famous American surveyor is undoubtedly George Washington. He surveyed parts of the western frontier of Virginia (now Culpeper, Frederick and Hampshire Counties) and the town of Alexandria, Virginia (near modern-day Washington D.C., which was founded and named in his honor many decades later). During the French and Indian War he sketched a map of his travels in what is now western Pennsylvania,1 which was published with his journal of that trip.2\nShow the code\nknitr::include_graphics(here(\"images/journal-of-g-washington-1754.jpg\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Title page of the Journal of Major George Washington, 1754\nShow the code\nknitr::include_graphics(here(\"images/Detail-from-Jefferson-map-300dpi.png\"))\n\n#knitr::include_graphics(here(\"images/journal-of-g-washington-1754.jpg\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Map included in the London edition of the Journal of Major George Washington, 1754, based on a sketch by the author . ‘Fort Pitt’ is the location of present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",

    "text": "Survey marks today\nAfter a surveying crew working as agents for the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) put in lot of work to find an accurate location, they place a mark to indicate the location and record the details in the NGS database. This makes it much less effort and expense to find an accurate location there or nearby in the future. Today the NGS manages the U.S. National Spatial Reference System, which includes more than 1.5 million survey points.\n\nEach of these survey marks provides one or more types of very accurate survey data. This data may include: latitude, longitude, elevation, magnetic, and gravity values….Surveyors, engineers, planners, mappers, and scientists use these survey marks to give their work accurate geographical reference and connection to the national survey network, called the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS). Because the NSRS provides the fundamental positional framework for the nation’s buildings, roads, utilities, and boundaries, we all ultimately benefit from their proper use.3\n\nMarks are designed to last, however their accuracy (and existence) over time is not assured.\nThus the sad story of mark FY3210.",

    "text": "1.1 In the beginning\nIn 1933, in the depths of the Depression, the U.S. Coast & Geodetic Survey (precursor to the NGS), placed survey triangulation mark FY3210 near the top of Occoneechee Mountain. How do we know? Because each mark has its own data sheet, and a datasheet tells a story.\nThe USGS QUAD is the name of the map quadrangle published by the U.S. Geological Survey. The Hillsboro (2019) 7.5 minute (1:24,000) quadrangle is here [115 MB PDF].\nThe CURRENT SURVEY CONTROL data include the latest location and elevation details and should be considered authoritative.\nThe next row is horizontal location. The latitude and longitude are based on NAD 83(2001), the North American Datum1 of 1983, wich the standard in use by the USGS today. The horizontal position is expressed in degrees, minutes, seconds in the North and West directions, latitude and longitude respectively. West is relative to the prime meridian at Greenwich, England). You can find Occoneechee Mountain on OpenStreetMap by searching for Occoneechee Mountain or latitude and longitude: 36°03’42.6”N 79°07’18.6”W (or their decimal equivalent: 36.06182, -79.12182).\nNAVD 88 is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, also the current standard. The orthographic height (“ortho height”) is defined relative to the datum. FY3210 is 262 meters (about 860 ft) above sea level.",

Yet the highest point in Orange Count NC is Occoneechee mountain3 where there are (or were) two marks near the peak: FY3210 and FY3209 at 262 m (859.6 ft). At the location of PID EZ2890 the elevation reported by SRTM NASA via CGIAR Consortium for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) is a more reasonable 231 m (757.9 ft), which if accurate, indicates the orhto_ht of EZ2890 has a 60% error. So I use the STRM/CGIAR-CSI elevation instead in Figure 1.3.↩︎\nSee Section 7.3 ↩︎",

    "text": "A Triangulation Station is a survey point established during a survey utilizing the triangulation surveying method. Triangulation consists of observing the angles at the vertices of adjacent triangles, measuring the lengths of some of their sides, and computing the lengths of the remaining sides. The goal of this procedure is to determine the horizontal positions (latitude and longitude) of the vertices of each triangle. The triangulation method thus produces horizontal positions for the survey mark but only approximate elevations. A given mark may have a more accurate elevation determined by a differential leveling.\n\n\n\n\nThere may be six or more survey disks in the vicinity of each Triangulation Station. The main station, marked with a Triangulation Station disk, contains the factory stamping “TRIANGULATION STATION” with an equilateral triangle in the center. The triangle was usually about 2 cm on each side although occasionally from c1911 to c1925 (ex PID = BM0627, PN0027, TT0805, & OF1769), flat Triangulation Station disks were used which had a triangle of about 2.5 cm on a side, similar to the later Traverse Station disks. Beginning about 1905, an underground mark was set two to four or more feet underground and centered so as to be directly under the surface mark. The underground marks were set to preserve the position if the surface mark was damaged or destroyed. Both disks contained the same factory stamping and the exact same designation (name) and date. Triangulation Stations were normally named for an area feature or the property owner. Just prior to setting, the disk would be stamped by the original surveyor, as for example, “JONES 1936.” In the NGS database, the name would be “JONES” and the year set 1936. The disk was usually set so that the stamping could be read by an observer facing north. The disk would be set in a concrete monument, or set in a drill-hole in a large structure or bedrock. The concrete monument is normally about flush with the ground’s surface, 12 inches in diameter, and 48 inches or more deep, see Figure 15, with the bottom larger in diameter to help resist frost heave. Standard practice at a Triangulation Station was to also set two Reference Marks and an Azimuth Mark. For a period of time, in the 1970s, underground marks were also set at Azimuth Marks, hence the possible total of six disks. Some sites had additional reference marks added and some sites had marks set by other organizations, so having more than six disks in the area was quite possible.\nREFERENCE MARKS - Reference Marks (RM) were set to assist in locating the Triangulation Station as well as to help determine if the Triangulation Station was undisturbed and in its original position. RMs could also be used to reset a station mark if required. Reference Marks were factory stamped with “REFERENCE MARK”and with an arrow pointing up, see Figure 40. The original surveyor stamped the RM with the name of the Triangulation Station plus the number of the RM and the date just prior to setting. For example, the first RM for station JONES would be stamped “JONES NO. 1 1936.” When setting, the surveyor rotated the disk until it pointed directly toward the Triangulation Station disk. The surveyor then measured the direction and distance from the Triangulation Station to the Reference Marks (RMs) and recorded the information as part of the station’s description. Later, if a surveyor attempting to find a Triangulation Station stumbled upon a RM first, the arrow and the published distance and direction between the RM and station would be valuable aids in the station recovery. To check the position of the Triangulation Station, the new surveyor could measure the angles and distances to the Reference Marks and compare them to the original values. Beginning in the 1920s, two Reference Marks per Triangulation Station were specified. Reference Marks were usually set within 30 meters (one tape length) of the station. They were numbered clockwise from north and set about 90 degrees apart. If a RM was destroyed, a new Reference Mark would be set using the next consecutive number. The disk would be set in a concrete monument, or set in a drill-hole in a large structure or bedrock.1",

    "text": "3.4 Station Description\nThe first entry was written by surveyor RDH. Did he lead the team that did the initial survey work and placed the mark?\nThe effort invested in describing the location of FY3210 and its reference marks suggests that finding marks placed years in the past can be challenging.\nMost marks are on private property. At this time Occoneechee Mountain was privately owned.\n FY3210                          STATION DESCRIPTION\n FY3210\n FY3210'DESCRIBED BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1933 (RDH)\n FY3210'ABOUT 1-1/2 MILES SOUTHWEST OF HILLSBORO, ON HIGHEST PART AND\n FY3210'WESTERN END OF THE OCCONEECHEE MOUNTAINS ON PROPERTY OF SCOTT\n FY3210'GATES.\nAtlantic White Flash was a brand of gasoline sold by the Atlantic Refining Company, later ARCO.\nFY3210'        TO REACH FROM HILLSBORO, GO SOUTH ACROSS THE ENO RIVER\nFY3210'ON ROUTE 70 TO ITS JUNCTION WITH ROUTE 14, AND THEN BEAR RIGHT\nFY3210'0.65 MILE ON ROUTE 14 TO FORK WITH A SIGN ATLANTIC FLASH IN THE\nFY3210'V OF THE FORKS.  \nIt was a rural, farming community, and there was a dirt road to the top of Occoneechee Mountain. A “dim road” is rarely used, may be partly overgrown with vegetation, and hard to see.\nFY3210'                TAKE RIGHTHAND GRAVEL FORK AND PROCEED 0.8 MILE\nFY3210'TO DIRT ROAD JUST BEYOND LARGE OAK WITH A TRIANGULAR BLAZE ON\nFY3210'THE LEFT.

PASS THROUGH GATE AND PROCEED 200 YARDS\nFY3210'TO LEFT TURN AT CROSSROADS AT A SMALL DOUBLE TREE WITH\nFY3210'TRIANGULAR BLAZE.  AFTER TURNING LEFT, GO ABOUT 150\nFY3210'YARDS TO DIM ROAD ON LEFT, AND FOLLOW ROAD ALONG RIDGE ABOUT\nFY3210'600 YARDS TO STATION SITE.  \nThe summit of Occoneechee mountain was wooded. It must have been challenging to see through the trees to do the triangulation.\nFY3210'                             STATION IS 13 METERS (43 FEET)\nFY3210'SOUTHEAST OF 16-INCH POST OAK, AND 9.5 METERS (31 FEET) EAST\nFY3210'OF TWIN CHESTNUT OAK 2 FEET IN DIAMETER AT ITS FORK.  THERE\nFY3210'IS A 6-INCH HICKORY BETWEEN STATION AND POST-OAK TREE.\nThree reference marks were set at the same time as FY3210–two within 100 ft and an azimuth mark a third of a mile away. There were exposed rocks at the summit in addition to trees: reference marks no. 1 and no. 2 were set in rocks two or more feet above ground.\nFY3210'SURFACE AND UNDERGROUND MARKS ARE STANDARD DISK STATION\nFY3210'MARKS IN CONCRETE, NOTES 1A AND 7A.  REFERENCE MARKS\nFY3210'NOS. 1 AND 2 ARE STANDARD REFERENCE DISKS IN STONE OUTCROPS,\nFY3210'NOTE 12A.\nFY3210'REFERENCE MARK NO 1 IS IN TOP OF A 5 BY 9-FOOT STONE WHICH\nFY3210'PROJECTS 3.9 FEET ABOVE GROUND, IN A LINE WITH AN ALUMINUM\nFY3210'WATER TANK AT FOOT OF HILL IN TOWN OF HILLSBORO AND\nFY3210'STATION, AND 22.16 METERS (72.7 FEET) FROM STATION\nFY3210'N 41 DEG 52 MIN E.\nFY3210'REFERENCE MARK NO 2 IS IN A DEPRESSION ABOUT 5 FEET BELOW\nFY3210'STATION, IN TOP OF 3 BY 4-FOOT GRANITE ROCK PROJECTING 2 FEET\nFY3210'OUT OF GROUND, 11 METERS (36 FEET) SOUTH OF THE CENTER LINE OF\nFY3210'ROAD TO STATION, AND 24.99 METERS (82.0 FEET) FROM STATION\nFY3210'S 65 DEG 16 MIN E.\nFY3210'REFERENCE MARK NO 3 IS STANDARD REFERENCE DISK\nFY3210'IN CONCRETE, NOTE 11A, LOCATED ACROSS ROAD FROM\nFY3210'CLEARED FIELD ON NORTH SIDE OF ROAD, 11 PACES SOUTH OF CENTER\nFY3210'LINE OF GRADED ROAD, ABOUT 6 FEET SOUTH OF DRAINAGE DITCH,\nFY3210'137 PACES WEST-SOUTHWEST OF ROAD LEADING FROM GRADED ROAD TO\nFY3210'STATION, AND APPROXIMATELY 0.3 MILE FROM STATION\nFY3210'S 32 DEG 56 MIN E.\nFY3210'THIS MARK IS NOT VISIBLE FROM GROUND WITHOUT CLEARING.\nA standpipe was a water tower, which must have been nearby.\n FY3210'BEARING FROM THE STATION TO\n FY3210'LEFT EDGE OF WHITE STANDPIPE IN HILLSBORO IS N 41 DEG 57 MIN E\n FY3210'AND TO RIGHT EDGE OF SAME STANDPIPE IS N 42 DEG 10 MIN E.\nFrom the location of FY3210, the standpipe’s width was 13 minutes or \\(\\frac{13}{60}^{th}\\) of a degree, which would make it about 20 ft wide if one mile away, or 30 ft wide if 1.5 miles away.3 Is this the same as the “ALUMINUM WATER TANK AT FOOT OF HILL IN TOWN OF HILLSBORO” mentioned earlier? I assume so.\nTODO: Find more (location, history, picture)\nhttps://openorangenc.org/buildings/hillsborough-water-treatment-plant would be promising; it’s near Occoneechee Mountain. But it wasn’t completed until 1936, and it’s not quite the right bearing.\nMaybe there’s something in here: https://www.orangecountync.gov/1246/Local-History-Collection\nHistorical Account of Public Water Supplies in North Carolina\nNC-WRRI-244.pdf from https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/items/e2c00774-13eb-4bb6-94e5-b7e3daa36ce2\n(not helpful)",

    "section": "5.3 Survey marks and model gravity",
    "text": "5.3 Survey marks and model gravity\nFigure 5.2 shows a general trend: in these four counties, gravity increases as you move to the northwest. This is somewhat counter-intuitive, since elevation is increasing (and thus gravity should be decreasing, all else being equal).\nBut of course all else is not equal. There are a number of dynamics at work here:2\n\nAs elevation increases, gravity decreases at a rate of about 0.5 mGal every 10 ft.\nThe radius of the earth is largest at the equator due to the buldge caused by the rotation of the earth. The radius at the poles is the smallest. Thus gravity is weakest at the equator (at constant elevation), and as you move north, gravity increases. At latitude 37 (just north of the NC border with Virginia) gravity increases at a rate of about 1.5 mGal/min. One minute is about 1.2 miles (6,300 ft or 1.9 km).\nDifferences in the density of the upper mantle, crust, and amount of water in the rocks affect local gravity. The three techniques used to model local gravity (Figure 5.9) all show a gravity anomalies in thr range of about 85 mGal. This is about the range we see in Figure 5.2, suggesting that the “modeled gravity” reported in the datasheets is drawing from a model like WGM2012. The data sheet notes that “The modeled gravity was interpolated from observed gravity values.” WGM2012 and any other useful model would use observed gravity to ground it as well, right?\n\nState-wide, the highest magnitude local gravity anomalies are in a band that includes Orange and Durham, the two north-most counties of our four counties (Figure 5.8, Figure 5.9) which also have the strongest gravity (Figure 5.4). The shape of the gradient seems to follow the fall line, suggesting to me that there is more denser rock in the crust of the Piedmont than in the transition to largely sedimentary rock to the southeast.

I assume the “arms” are the result of differing density in the ground in Orange and Chatham counties (more specifically: differing density gradients, since in these “arms” as elevation increases, the gravity stays approximately constant.

The terrane contains rocks associated with a series of oceanic volcanic islands about 540-630 million years ago. The terrane is known for its numerous abandoned gold mines and prospects. North Carolina led the nation in gold production before the California Gold Rush of 1849. In recent decades, only minor gold mining has taken place, but mining companies continue to show interest in the area. Mineral production is crushed stone for road aggregate, light-weight aggregate and pyrophyllite for refractories, ceramics, fillers, paint and insecticide carriers.\nGreen: Triassic basin - Deep River basin: Triassic basins: The Triassic basins are filled with sedimentary rocks that formed about 220 million years ago. Streams carried mud, silt, sand and gravel, from adjacent highlands into rift valleys similar to those of Africa today. The Triassic basins formed when the super continent Pangea began to split apart. The mudstones are mined and processed to make brick, sewer pipe, structural tile and drain tiles. Coal deposits have been mined in the past. Potential deposits of natural gas are present in the Triassic basins of North Carolina.\nRed: Diabase: Diabase is an igneous rock that occurs as sills and dikes within the Triassic basins and is present as dikes throughout the Piedmont of the State. Diabase intruded into the existing rock of the State approximately 200 million years ago as the Atlantic Ocean was beginning to form during the breakup of the super continent Pangea. Diabase is a good source of crushed stone. The fractures present in weathered diabase dikes and sills can be important sources of groundwater.\nPurple: Crabtree terrane: The terrane consists mostly of metamorphosed igneous, volcanic, and sedimentary rocks. A unique rock of the terrane includes the graphitic schist in the Raleigh area. These rocks were part of a large chain of ancient volcanic islands that formed off the coast of the ancient continent called Gondwana. The igneous rocks are good sources for crushed stone for road aggregate and construction purposes.\nBlue-purple: Raleigh terrane: The terrane consists mostly of metamorphosed igneous rocks. The rocks were part of a large chain of ancient volcanic islands that formed off the coast of the ancient continent called Gondwana. In the 19th century, there were a number of small building stone quarries in this region, but today the main mineral product is crushed stone for construction and road aggregate.\nGrey: Falls Lake terrane: The terrane consists mostly of metamorphosed sedimentary rock and lesser amounts of metamorphosed igneous rocks. The terrane is dominated by the Falls Lake schist. Historically, the terrane is known as a source of talc that was used by early settlers for carving tombstones. The rocks were part of a large chain of ancient volcanic islands that formed off the coast of the ancient continent called Gondwana.\nPink: Late Paleozoic intrusions: Late Paleozoic intrusions are mainly composed of the igneous rock granite and granodiorite. These rocks intruded as giant blobs of molten rock (magma) during the formation of the Appalachian Mountain chain (approximately 280 to 320 million years ago). Late Paleozoic granites and granodiorites are good sources of crushed stone, quartz, feldspar, and mica. This rock type is also linked to areas with elevated Radon concentrations in air and groundwater.\nBrown: Spring Hope terrane: This terrane contains slightly metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks similar to those to the Carolina terrane. The rocks are poorly exposed and partially covered by Coastal Plain sediments. The metamorphic rocks, 525 to 630 million years old, are intruded by approximately 300 million year old granitic bodies. Gold was once mined in the terrane, and small occurrences of molybdenite, an ore of molybdenum, have been prospected here. Crushed stone, clay, sand and gravel are currently mined in this belt.\nYellow: Coastal Plain: The Coastal Plain is a wedge of mostly marine sedimentary rocks that gradually thickens to the east. The Coastal Plain is the largest geologic element in the state, covering about 45 percent of the land area. The most common sediment types are sand and clay, although a significant amount of limestone occurs in the southern part of the Coastal Plain. In the Coastal Plain, geology is best understood from studying data gathered from well drilling. The state’s most important mineral resource in terms of dollar value is phosphate, an important fertilizer component mined near Aurora, Beaufort County. Industrial sand for making glass, for use in filtration and sandblasting is mined in the Sandhills area.",

It has been realized by the Bureau Gravimétrique International (BGI) in the frame of collaborations with international organizations such as Commission for the Geological Map of the World (CGMW), UNESCO, International Association of Geodesy (IAG), International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG), International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) and with various scientific institutions.\n\n\nWGM2012 gravity anomalies are derived from the available Earth global gravity models EGM2008 and DTU10 and include 1’x1′ resolution terrain corrections derived from ETOPO1 model that consider the contribution of most surface masses (atmosphere, land, oceans, inland seas, lakes, ice caps and ice shelves). These products have been computed by means of a spherical harmonic approach using theoretical developments carried out to achieve accurate computations at global scale (Balmino, G., Vales, N., Bonvalot, S. and Briais, A., 2011. Spherical harmonic modeling to ultra-high degree of Bouguer and isostatic anomalies. Journal of Geodesy.

There is one additional data set which accompany this layer, dikes.\nThis geology is considered deprecated (not recommended for use) by the NC Geological Survey. There is currently no replacement for it that covers the whole state. We are working on a replacement that will be made available to the public in the near future (2024). This new dataset will be in the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geologic Map Schema (GeMS). When first released this data set will only cover a portion of the State at a scale of 1:100,000. This dataset will be dynamic and expand to cover the whole state by as early as 2030 at which point this layer will be removed from service.",

    "section": "7.4 Mark types",
    "text": "7.4 Mark types\n\nIn a geodetic context, the terms “survey mark” and “bench mark” are not the same. A bench mark is a specific type of survey mark that has a known elevation above or below an adopted surface or datum. Survey mark refers to any permanent marks or disks placed in the ground or attached to a permanent structure with known latitude, longitude or height information. Other terms used for survey mark are “survey point” or “control point.” Colloquially (and incorrectly) bench mark is used interchangeably with survey mark.8\n\nBelow are the most common types of marks, summarized by George Leigh9. Since the counties in focus are well inland I ignore other mark types used to mark high water or at sea.\n\nThere may be six or more survey disks in the vicinity of each Triangulation Station…. The main station, marked with a Triangulation Station disk, contains the factory stamping “TRIANGULATION STATION” with an equilateral triangle in the center….Beginning about 1905, an underground mark was set two to four or more feet underground and centered so as to be directly under the surface mark….Standard practice at a Triangulation Station was to also set two Reference Marks and an Azimuth Mark. For a period of time, in the 1970s, underground marks were also set at Azimuth Marks, hence the possible total of six disks. Some sites had additional reference marks added and some sites had marks set by other organizations, so having more than six disks in the area was quite possible.\n\nBENCH MARKS - A Bench Mark is a marked point whose elevation above or below an adopted geodetic vertical datum is known with a certain amount of accuracy.\nTRIANGULATION STATIONS - A Triangulation Station is a survey point established during a survey utilizing the triangulation surveying method\nREFERENCE MARKS - Reference Marks (RM) were set to assist in locating the Triangulation Station as well as to help determine if the Triangulation Station was undisturbed and in its original position.\nAZIMUTH MARKS – Beginning in 1927, a third Reference Mark, or “long RM”, was set about 1⁄4 mile distant from the Triangulation Station for use in providing a starting azimuth (direction) for local surveys. It was also used for determining magnetic declination, which is the difference between true north and magnetic north. Standard Azimuth Mark disks replaced azimuth reference marks about 1935.\nMAGNETIC STATIONS – The Survey began magnetic observations in 1843. The original purpose was to supply magnetic information for the nautical charts, but later observations were extended into the interior to aid local surveyors.\nGRAVITY STATIONS – The Survey began gravity observations in 1871…. Gravity observations were sometimes also made near the Gravity Station Reference Marks.\nGRAVITY STATION REFERENCE MARKS –Gravity Station RM disks were set to indicate the direction to the location of the gravity observations, rather than the direction to a Gravity Station disk.\nTOPOGRAPHIC STATIONS - Topographic Station disks were set in preparation for, or during, topographic surveys, i.e. coastal mapping, and also on airports during airport surveys.\nTRAVERSE STATIONS – This type of disk was set during traverse surveys, a type of survey that determines positions by means of a series of angles and distances between adjacent points along a route.\nUSC&GS AND STATE SURVEY DISKS – This type of disk was used when cooperative surveys were conducted with state agencies, and by federal government work programs during the 1930s.\n\n\nMost marks are traverse station disks (set during traverse surveys) and their replacements, horizontal control marks.10\nThere are many kinds of marks rarely found in these four counties–though there is one lookout tower (Section 3.11).\n\n\nShow the code\ndata_for_plot &lt;- nc_marks_counties |&gt;\n  st_drop_geometry() |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(last_recv),\n         !is.na(first_recv)) |&gt;\n  mutate(first_recv = as.numeric(str_extract(first_recv, \"^[0-9]{4}\")),\n         last_recv = as.numeric(str_extract(last_recv, \"^[0-9]{4}\"))\n         ) |&gt;\n  mutate(decade_first_recv = floor(first_recv / 10) * 10,\n         decade_last_recv = floor(last_recv / 10) * 10) |&gt;\n  mutate(decade_last_recv = floor(last_recv / 10) * 10) |&gt;\n  replace_na(list(setting = \"0 = UNSPECIFIED SETTING\",\n                  marker = \"DO = NOT SPECIFIED OR SEE DESCRIPTION\")) \n\ndata_for_plot |&gt;\n  count(decade_last_recv, marker) |&gt;\n  arrange(decade_last_recv) |&gt;\n  mutate(decade_last_recv = as_factor(decade_last_recv),\n         marker = fct_reorder(marker, n, sum)\n  ) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(n, marker, fill = decade_last_recv, group = marker)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = TRUE,\n           alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(end = 0.9) +\n  theme(legend.position = c(0.7, 0.4)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Survey and bench mark types: last recovery\",\n    subtitle = glue(\"Count of mark types by decade last recovered\",\n                    \"\\n{comma(n_marks_counties)} marks in {n_counties} NC counties\"),\n    x = NULL,\n    y = NULL,\n    caption = my_caption\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Survey and bench mark types: last recovery",

Leigh, NOAA Corps (Ret’d.) for his informative history: BOTTLES, POTS, & PANS? – MARKING THE SURVEYS OF THE U.S. COAST & GEODETIC SURVEY AND NOAA.11\nThanks to the National Geodetic Survey, NOAA for making survey mark data so easily accessible.\nThanks to NASA and CGIAR for area elevation data. Marks provide a point elevation. I supplement that with continuous elevation data collected by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM NASA, Wikipedia) which is available through multiple sources. I use data post-processed by the CGIAR Consortium for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) made available in the elevatr R package via Amazon Web Services Terrain Tiles and the Open Topography global datasets API in (Figure 1.3 and other maps showing area elevations).\nThanks to the US Census Bureau for making population and geographical data easily accessible. I accesses this data using the tidycensus and tigris R packages.\nThanks to the many people developing and evolving the high-quality open source R ecosystem for data analysis and visualization.\nother attached packages:\n [1] broman_0.80     ggmosaic_0.3.3  ggbump_0.1.0    gt_0.10.1       osmdata_0.2.5   patchwork_1.2.0 stars_0.6-4    \n [8] abind_1.4-5     tigris_2.1      tidycensus_1.6  elevatr_0.99.0  tidyterra_0.5.2 terra_1.7-71    sf_1.0-15      \n[15] glue_1.7.0      janitor_2.2.0   units_0.8-5     scales_1.3.0    lubridate_1.9.3 forcats_1.0.0   stringr_1.5.1  \n[22] dplyr_1.1.4     purrr_1.0.2     readr_2.1.5     tidyr_1.3.1     tibble_3.2.1    ggplot2_3.4.4   tidyverse_2.0.0\n[29] here_1.0.1",
