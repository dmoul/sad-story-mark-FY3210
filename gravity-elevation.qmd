Since the datasheets include modeled gravity, let's see what we can learn.

## Introduction: Gravity and elevation

What does gravity have to do with elevation? And why is it interesting enough to dwell on here? All other things being equal, stepping on a scale at higher elevation results in a lower reading on the scale (if the scale is accurate enough!). And *local gravity* varies for more reasons than elevation.


### Simple explanation

Ignoring local conditions, the acceleration due to gravity $g$ at altitude $h$ above sea level is 

$$
g_{altitude} = g(\frac{r_e}{r_e + h})^2
$$ {#eq-gravity}

where radius of the earth $r_e = 6371.009\ km$ and acceleration due to gravity at sea level is $9.80665\ m/s^2$ ^[<https://www.vcalc.com/wiki/KurtHeckman/Gravity+Acceleration+by+Altitude> ]. *Altitude* is another name for *elevation* and is measured relative to a specific vertical [datum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_datum). In the case of US survey marks, the datum used here is the North American vertical datum of 1988 (NAVD 88).


### Less simple explanation

A less simple model takes into account the earth's spining causing a larger radius at the equator than at the poles. As noted at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_gravity#Basic_formulas> :

> WELMEC formula: In all German standards offices the free-fall acceleration g is calculated in respect to the average latitude $lat$ and the average height above sea level $h$ with the WELMEC–Formel:
> 

Which we can write as follows:

$$
g(lat, h) = 9.780318 \frac{m}{s^2}\ (1 + 0.0053024\ sin^2 (lat) - 0.0000058 sin^2(2\ lat) - 0.000003085 \frac{1}{s^2}\ h
$$ {#eq-welmec}

This change in gravity due to latitude can be visualized as follows.

## Modeled gravity

Since we cannot afford to measure gravity in every location, we use *modeled gravity*. For example, as noted in the datasheet for PID [EZ0704](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=EZ0704):

```

## Survey marks and model gravity

@fig-counties-gravity shows a general trend: in these four counties, gravity increases as you move to the northwest. This is somewhat counter-intuitive, since elevation is increasing (and thus gravity should be decreasing, all else being equal).

But of course all else is not equal. There are a number of dynamics at work here:^[The numbers in this section are from the Dictionary of Terms webpage National Centers of Environmental Information, NOAA. Retrieved 2024-02-27.  <https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/gravity/1999/document/supplmnt/dctnary/98terms.html>]

1. As elevation increases, gravity decreases at a rate of about 0.5 mGal every 10 ft.
1. The radius of the earth is largest at the equator due to the buldge caused by the rotation of the earth. The radius at the poles is the smallest. Thus gravity is weakest at the equator (at constant elevation), and as you move north, gravity increases. At latitude 37 (just north of the NC border with Virginia) gravity increases at a rate of about 1.5 mGal/min. One minute is about 1.2 miles (6,300 ft or 1.9 km).
1. Differences in the density of the upper mantle, crust, and amount of water in the rocks affect local gravity. The three techniques used to model local gravity (@fig-bgi-isosgtatic-bouguer-freeair) all show a gravity anomalies in thr range of about 85 mGal. This is about the range we see in @fig-counties-gravity, suggesting that the "modeled gravity" reported in the datasheets is drawing from a model like WGM2012. The data sheet notes that "The modeled gravity was interpolated from observed gravity values." WGM2012 and any other useful model would use observed gravity to ground it as well, right?

State-wide, the highest magnitude local gravity anomalies are in a band that includes Orange and Durham, the two north-most counties of our four counties (@fig-bgi-bouguer-state, @fig-bgi-isosgtatic-bouguer-freeair) which also have the strongest gravity (@fig-gravity-comparisons-theoretical). The shape of the gradient seems to follow the fall line, suggesting to me that there is more denser rock in the crust of the Piedmont than in the transition to largely sedimentary rock to the southeast. In other words, (3) seems to be overpowering (1) and (2) in these counties. I assume the full answer is not that simple.

@fig-gravity-height-histogram shows there is not a 1:1 correspondence between model_grav and ortho_ht. The shape of panel B somewhat matches the shape of the left half of panel A. But why are there two extra sections in panel A with higher gravity?

## Local gravity makes things interesting

The two extra "bumps" in @fig-gravity-height-histogram panel A correspond to the top two teal-blue horizontal "arms" in @fig-gravity-comparisons-theoretical (the second large arm in red is hidden in the main shape of @fig-gravity-height-histogram panel A). I assume the "arms" are the result of differing density in the ground in Orange and Chatham counties (more specifically: differing density gradients, since in these "arms" as elevation increases, the gravity stays approximately constant. In other words, the geology of these two pairs of counties includes similar gradients in density at different mean elevations.

The red line is the result of using average gravity in the simple formula @eq-gravity presented at the beginning of this chapter. The results are too high by about 800 mGal than the model gravity, which reflect the adjustment of latitude in @eq-welmec, which is the blue line.

See also the method used by the NGS which is more sophisticated in pursuit of greater accuracy^[<https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/Gravity/grav_method.html> ], including some values being "interpolated from observed gravity values".

Legend (text copied from map):

* Blue: Carolina terrane: This terrane consists of heated and deformed volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The terrane contains rocks associated with a series of oceanic volcanic islands about 540-630 million years ago. The terrane is known for its numerous abandoned gold mines and prospects. North Carolina led the nation in gold production before the California Gold Rush of 1849. In recent decades, only minor gold mining has taken place, but mining companies continue to show interest in the area. Mineral production is crushed stone for road aggregate, light-weight aggregate and pyrophyllite for refractories, ceramics, fillers, paint and insecticide carriers.

* Green: Triassic basin - Deep River basin: Triassic basins: The Triassic basins are filled with sedimentary rocks that formed about 220 million years ago. Streams carried mud, silt, sand and gravel, from adjacent highlands into rift valleys similar to those of Africa today. The Triassic basins formed when the super continent Pangea began to split apart. The mudstones are mined and processed to make brick, sewer pipe, structural tile and drain tiles. Coal deposits have been mined in the past. Potential deposits of natural gas are present in the Triassic basins of North Carolina.

* Red: Diabase: Diabase is an igneous rock that occurs as sills and dikes within the Triassic basins and is present as dikes throughout the Piedmont of the State. Diabase intruded into the existing rock of the State approximately 200 million years ago as the Atlantic Ocean was beginning to form during the breakup of the super continent Pangea. Diabase is a good source of crushed stone. The fractures present in weathered diabase dikes and sills can be important sources of groundwater.

* Purple: Crabtree terrane: The terrane consists mostly of metamorphosed igneous, volcanic, and sedimentary rocks. A unique rock of the terrane includes the graphitic schist in the Raleigh area. These rocks were part of a large chain of ancient volcanic islands that formed off the coast of the ancient continent called Gondwana. The igneous rocks are good sources for crushed stone for road aggregate and construction purposes.

* Blue-purple: Raleigh terrane: The terrane consists mostly of metamorphosed igneous rocks. The rocks were part of a large chain of ancient volcanic islands that formed off the coast of the ancient continent called Gondwana. In the 19th century, there were a number of small building stone quarries in this region, but today the main mineral product is crushed stone for construction and road aggregate.

* Grey: Falls Lake terrane: The terrane consists mostly of metamorphosed sedimentary rock and lesser amounts of metamorphosed igneous rocks. The terrane is dominated by the Falls Lake schist. Historically, the terrane is known as a source of talc that was used by early settlers for carving tombstones. The rocks were part of a large chain of ancient volcanic islands that formed off the coast of the ancient continent called Gondwana.

* Pink: Late Paleozoic intrusions: Late Paleozoic intrusions are mainly composed of the igneous rock granite and granodiorite. These rocks intruded as giant blobs of molten rock (magma) during the formation of the Appalachian Mountain chain (approximately 280 to 320 million years ago). Late Paleozoic granites and granodiorites are good sources of crushed stone, quartz, feldspar, and mica. This rock type is also linked to areas with elevated Radon concentrations in air and groundwater.

* Brown: Spring Hope terrane: This terrane contains slightly metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks similar to those to the Carolina terrane. The rocks are poorly exposed and partially covered by Coastal Plain sediments. The metamorphic rocks, 525 to 630 million years old, are intruded by approximately 300 million year old granitic bodies. Gold was once mined in the terrane, and small occurrences of molybdenite, an ore of molybdenum, have been prospected here. Crushed stone, clay, sand and gravel are currently mined in this belt.

* Yellow: Coastal Plain: The Coastal Plain is a wedge of mostly marine sedimentary rocks that gradually thickens to the east. The Coastal Plain is the largest geologic element in the state, covering about 45 percent of the land area. The most common sediment types are sand and clay, although a significant amount of limestone occurs in the southern part of the Coastal Plain. In the Coastal Plain, geology is best understood from studying data gathered from well drilling. The state's most important mineral resource in terms of dollar value is phosphate, an important fertilizer component mined near Aurora, Beaufort County. Industrial sand for making glass, for use in filtration and sandblasting is mined in the Sandhills area.

> WGM2012 is the first release of a high resolution grids and maps of the Earth’s gravity anomalies (Bouguer, isostatic and surface free-air), computed at global scale in spherical geometry. It has been realized by the Bureau Gravimétrique International (BGI) in the frame of collaborations with international organizations such as Commission for the Geological Map of the World (CGMW), UNESCO, International Association of Geodesy (IAG), International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG), International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) and with various scientific institutions.

> WGM2012 gravity anomalies are derived from the available Earth global gravity models EGM2008 and DTU10 and include 1’x1′ resolution terrain corrections derived from ETOPO1 model that consider the contribution of most surface masses (atmosphere, land, oceans, inland seas, lakes, ice caps and ice shelves). These products have been computed by means of a spherical harmonic approach using theoretical developments carried out to achieve accurate computations at global scale (Balmino, G., Vales, N., Bonvalot, S. and Briais, A., 2011. Spherical harmonic modeling to ultra-high degree of Bouguer and isostatic anomalies. Journal of Geodesy. DOI 10.1007/s00190-011-0533-4).
