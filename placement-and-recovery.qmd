Our mark had every advantage as a highly valued triangulation station disk, at the highest elevation in the county, set in concrete to last, near Hillsboro, the county seat, and set by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Society (precursor to the NGS) -- the pre-eminent surveying agency in the US government.

## Triangulation station

> A Triangulation Station is a survey point established during a survey utilizing the triangulation surveying method.  Triangulation consists of observing the angles at the vertices of adjacent triangles, measuring the lengths of some of their sides, and computing the lengths of the remaining sides. The goal of this procedure is to determine the horizontal positions (latitude and longitude) of the vertices of each triangle. The triangulation method thus produces horizontal positions for the survey mark but only approximate elevations. A given mark may have a more accurate elevation determined by a differential leveling.

> There may be six or more survey disks in the vicinity of each Triangulation Station. The main station, marked with a Triangulation Station disk, contains the factory stamping “TRIANGULATION STATION” with an equilateral triangle in the center. The triangle was usually about 2 cm on each side although occasionally from c1911 to c1925 (ex PID = BM0627, PN0027, TT0805, & OF1769), flat Triangulation Station disks were used which had a triangle of about 2.5 cm on a side, similar to the later Traverse Station disks. Beginning about 1905, an underground mark was set two to four or more feet underground and centered so as to be directly under the surface mark. The underground marks were set to preserve the position if the surface mark was damaged or destroyed. Both disks contained the same factory stamping and the exact same designation (name) and date. Triangulation Stations were normally named for an area feature or the property owner. Just prior to setting, the disk would be stamped by the original surveyor, as for example, “JONES 1936.” In the NGS database, the name would be “JONES” and the year set 1936. The disk was usually set so that the stamping could be read by an observer facing north. The disk would be set in a concrete monument, or set in a drill-hole in a large structure or bedrock. The concrete monument is normally about flush with the ground’s surface, 12 inches in diameter, and 48 inches or more deep, see Figure 15, with the bottom larger in diameter to help resist frost heave. Standard practice at a Triangulation Station was to also set two Reference Marks and an Azimuth Mark. For a period of time, in the 1970s, underground marks were also set at Azimuth Marks, hence the possible total of six disks. Some sites had additional reference marks added and some sites had marks set by other organizations, so having
more than six disks in the area was quite possible.
> 
> REFERENCE MARKS - Reference Marks (RM) were set to assist in locating the Triangulation Station as well as to help determine if the Triangulation Station was undisturbed and in its original position. RMs could also be used to reset a station mark if required. Reference Marks were factory stamped with “REFERENCE MARK”and with an arrow pointing up, see Figure 40. The original surveyor stamped the RM with the name of the Triangulation Station plus the number of the RM and the date just prior to setting. For example, the first RM for station JONES would be stamped “JONES NO. 1 1936.” When setting, the surveyor rotated the disk until it pointed directly toward the Triangulation Station disk. The surveyor then measured the direction and distance from the Triangulation Station to the Reference Marks (RMs) and recorded the information as part of the station’s description. Later, if a surveyor attempting to find a Triangulation Station stumbled upon a RM first, the arrow and the published distance and direction between the RM and station would be valuable aids in the station recovery. To check the position of the Triangulation Station, the new surveyor could measure the angles and distances to the Reference Marks and compare them to the original values. Beginning in the 1920s, two Reference Marks per Triangulation Station were specified. Reference Marks were usually set within 30 meters (one tape length) of the station. They were numbered clockwise from north and set about 90 degrees apart. If a RM was destroyed, a new Reference Mark would be set using the next consecutive number. The disk would be set in a concrete monument, or set in a drill-hole in a large structure or bedrock.^[George, pages 17=18]

Triangulation stations are only one of many kinds of marks...

## Setting

Like FY3210, most marks are placed in concrete (@fig-mark-settings).

> The three most important characteristics of survey marks are
stability, longevity, and the ability of future surveyors to find
and use the mark. In other words, the mark shouldn’t move,
wash away, rust away, and/or be destroyed by cultural
development, and surveyors returning to the point need to be
able to find it and positively identify it. The mark needs to
remain very stable or the survey values will no longer be
valid.^[Leigh, p 2]

## History
 
Next comes a summary history section. Here I show only the entry for the initial placement: "MONUMENTED".
 
 ```

## Station Description

The first entry was written by surveyor RDH. Did he lead the team that did the initial survey work and placed the mark? 

The effort invested in describing the location of FY3210 and its reference marks suggests that finding marks placed years in the past can be challenging.

Most marks are on private property. At this time Occoneechee Mountain was privately owned.

```

 FY3210
 FY3210'DESCRIBED BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1933 (RDH)
 FY3210'ABOUT 1-1/2 MILES SOUTHWEST OF HILLSBORO, ON HIGHEST PART AND
 FY3210'WESTERN END OF THE OCCONEECHEE MOUNTAINS ON PROPERTY OF SCOTT

 ```
 
Atlantic White Flash was a brand of gasoline sold by the Atlantic Refining Company, later ARCO.
 
 ```

 FY3210'0.65 MILE ON ROUTE 14 TO FORK WITH A SIGN ATLANTIC FLASH IN THE
 FY3210'V OF THE FORKS.  
 ```
 
It was a rural, farming community, and there was a dirt road to the top of Occoneechee Mountain. A "dim road" is rarely used, may be partly overgrown with vegetation, and hard to see.
 
 ```

 FY3210'600 YARDS TO STATION SITE.  
 ```
 
The summit of Occoneechee mountain was wooded. It must have been challenging to see through the trees to do the triangulation.
 
 ```
 FY3210'                             STATION IS 13 METERS (43 FEET)
 FY3210'SOUTHEAST OF 16-INCH POST OAK, AND 9.5 METERS (31 FEET) EAST
 FY3210'OF TWIN CHESTNUT OAK 2 FEET IN DIAMETER AT ITS FORK.  THERE
 FY3210'IS A 6-INCH HICKORY BETWEEN STATION AND POST-OAK TREE.
 ```
 
Three reference marks were set at the same time as FY3210--two within 100 ft and an azimuth mark a third of a mile away. There were exposed rocks at the summit in addition to trees: reference marks no. 1 and no. 2 were set in rocks two or more feet above ground.
 
 ```
 FY3210'SURFACE AND UNDERGROUND MARKS ARE STANDARD DISK STATION
 FY3210'MARKS IN CONCRETE, NOTES 1A AND 7A.  REFERENCE MARKS
 FY3210'NOS. 1 AND 2 ARE STANDARD REFERENCE DISKS IN STONE OUTCROPS,
 FY3210'NOTE 12A.
 FY3210'REFERENCE MARK NO 1 IS IN TOP OF A 5 BY 9-FOOT STONE WHICH
 FY3210'PROJECTS 3.9 FEET ABOVE GROUND, IN A LINE WITH AN ALUMINUM
 FY3210'WATER TANK AT FOOT OF HILL IN TOWN OF HILLSBORO AND
 FY3210'STATION, AND 22.16 METERS (72.7 FEET) FROM STATION

 FY3210'STATION, IN TOP OF 3 BY 4-FOOT GRANITE ROCK PROJECTING 2 FEET
 FY3210'OUT OF GROUND, 11 METERS (36 FEET) SOUTH OF THE CENTER LINE OF
 FY3210'ROAD TO STATION, AND 24.99 METERS (82.0 FEET) FROM STATION
 FY3210'S 65 DEG 16 MIN E.
 FY3210'REFERENCE MARK NO 3 IS STANDARD REFERENCE DISK
 FY3210'IN CONCRETE, NOTE 11A, LOCATED ACROSS ROAD FROM

 FY3210'137 PACES WEST-SOUTHWEST OF ROAD LEADING FROM GRADED ROAD TO
 FY3210'STATION, AND APPROXIMATELY 0.3 MILE FROM STATION
 FY3210'S 32 DEG 56 MIN E.
 FY3210'THIS MARK IS NOT VISIBLE FROM GROUND WITHOUT CLEARING.
```

A standpipe was a water tower, which must have been nearby. 

```
 FY3210'BEARING FROM THE STATION TO
 FY3210'LEFT EDGE OF WHITE STANDPIPE IN HILLSBORO IS N 41 DEG 57 MIN E
 FY3210'AND TO RIGHT EDGE OF SAME STANDPIPE IS N 42 DEG 10 MIN E.
```

From the location of FY3210, the standpipe's width was 13 minutes or $\frac{13}{60}^{th}$ of a degree, which would make it about `r round(1 * 5280 * sin(13/60 * pi/180))` ft wide if one mile away, or `r round(1.5 * 5280 * sin(13/60 * pi/180))` ft wide if 1.5 miles away.^[My calculation: $r\sin\theta = width$, $1 * 5280 ft * sin(13/60 * pi/180) ≈ 20 ft$. ] I assume this is the "ALUMINUM WATER TANK AT FOOT OF HILL IN TOWN OF HILLSBORO" mentioned earlier.

***TODO: Find more (location, history, picture)***
 
<https://openorangenc.org/buildings/hillsborough-water-treatment-plant> would be promising; it's near Occoneechee Mountain. But it wasn't completed until 1936, and it's not quite the right bearing.

## Station recovery

Marks are occasionally "recovered". For FY3210 the first recovery was 21 years after placement.

```
 FY3210                          STATION RECOVERY (1954)
 FY3210
 FY3210'RECOVERY NOTE BY COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 1954 (ELJ)
 FY3210'STATION AND ALL MARKS WERE RECOVERED IN GOOD CONDITION.  THE
 FY3210'DIRECTIONS TO ALL MARKS WERE CHECKED AND FOUND CORRECT.  THE
 FY3210'DISTANCES TO R.M. NO. 2 AND R.M. NO. 3 WERE CHECKED AND FOUND
 FY3210'CORRECT.
```

Good news! All marks were recovered in good condition. This is not always the case (@???).

## "Original description is correct except..."

A lot can happen in 21 years. The land is now leased by the Forest Station, and they built a lookout tower with one leg only 11 ft from FY3210.

```
 FY3210'                                                      THE

 FY3210'MEASUREMENTS TO THE LOOKOUT TOWER WHICH HAS BEEN BUILT NEAR THE
 FY3210'STATION.  A NEW DESCRIPTION FOLLOWS--
 FY3210'
 FY3210'STATION IS LOCATED ABOUT 1-1/2 MILES SOUTHWEST OF HILLSBORO
 FY3210'ON WEST END OF A HIGH HILL AND IS ON PROPERTY LEASED BY THE
 FY3210'STATE FOREST SERVICE.  IT IS 31 FEET EAST OF A TWIN 24 INCH OAK
 FY3210'TREE, 18 FEET SOUTHWEST OF THE NORTHWEST LEG AND 11 FEET
 FY3210'NORTHWEST OF THE SOUTHWEST LEG OF THE HILLSBORO LOOKOUT

 FY3210'STAMPED---HILLSBORO 1933--- (NOTES 1A, 7A).
 FY3210'
 FY3210'REFERENCE MARK NO. 1 IS 72.64 FEET NORTHEAST OF THE STATION,
 FY3210'45 FEET NORTH OF THE NORTHEAST LEG OF THE LOOKOUT TOWER.  THE
 FY3210'DISK IS SET FLUSH IN A DRILL HOLE IN THE TOP OF A 5 X 9 FOOT
 FY3210'GRANITE BOULDER WHICH PROJECTS ABOUT 4 FEET AND IS
 FY3210'STAMPED---HILLSBORO NO 1 1933--- (NOTE 12 A).
```

There is now a power line pole 10 ft from reference mark no. 2. 

```
 FY3210'REFERENCE MARK NO. 2 IS ABOUT 5 FEET LOWER IN ELEVATION THAN
 FY3210'THE STATION, 82.00 FEET SOUTHEAST OF THE STATION, 54 FEET
 FY3210'SOUTHEAST OF THE SOUTHEAST LEG OF THE LOOKOUT TOWER AND 10 FEET
 FY3210'NORTHWEST OF A POWER LINE POLE WITH METER ATTACHED.  THE DISK
 FY3210'IS FLUSH IN A DRILL HOLE IN THE TOP OF A 3 X 4 FOOT GRANITE
 FY3210'BOULDER WHICH PROJECTS ABOUT 2 FEET AND IS STAMPED---HILLSBORO

 ```
 
There is now a white [witness post](https://www.universalhub.com/2022/you-never-know-what-youll-see-witness-post) a foot from reference mark 3.
 
 ```
 FY3210'REFERENCE MARK NO. 3 IS APPROX. 0.3 MILE SOUTHEAST OF THE
 FY3210'STATION, 33 FEET SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER OF THE ROAD TO THE
 FY3210'STATION AND 1 FOOT NORTHWEST OF A WHITE WITNESS POST.  THE MARK
 FY3210'PROJECTS ABOUT 8 INCHES AND THE DISK IS STAMPED---HILLSBORO NO 3

## Next recovery: 1961

Good news in general, however only seven years later "heavy growth" reduced the utility of reference mark no. 3. Surveyor WCF was a man of few words.

## More changes in the 60s

By the end of the sixties there were new roads, a microwave mast on the tower, a locked gate, and a key to collect from city hall. Mark no. 3 was lost. Perhaps the road it was near was widened or the verge was graded.

## The sad end

Fast-forward 16 years, and we find obliteration. New radio equipment needed a shelter, and a metal shed now covers where the mark is (or was). Reference mark no. 1 is still doing it's job, though it suffered some damage. Mark no. 2 is simply gone from its bore hole in the boulder, and mark no. 3 is confirmed truly gone.

## The end of the end

The next attempt to recover it 19 years is a bleak epilog: now even the partially defaced reference mark is gone. I hear sadness at the end of a diligent search in the words "No marker could be found".

## The mission continues {#sec-mission-continues}

But the survey mission endures. Nearby mark [FY3209](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=FY3209) has been located under the lookout tower owned by the NC State Forest Service since 1954.
